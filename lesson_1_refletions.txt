How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you 
see the bug that was introduced?

very nice

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file 
make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

very very nice

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing 
when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having 
versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

yes, very nice.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow 
saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google 
Docs, treat each file separately?

yeah, i know right.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the 
history of files?

please now..

How might using version control make you more confident to 
make changes that could break something?

aarrggghhhh
